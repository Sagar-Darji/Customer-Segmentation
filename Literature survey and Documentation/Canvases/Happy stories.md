<p>Once there was a very young computer graduate who had a new idea for starting a startup but he had not enough money to start a startup but any how he managed and got the funding from his college. Perhaps the amount was tight to budget even we can say that less than required amount. He has to make expenses choices. Because of  his good resource management skill and wise nature, He has invest his a little time to research more and in customer segmentation before starting any other expenditure. Eventually this master step benefited to him and saved a lot of fund from the random marketing cost, just because of customer segmentation. He's just focusing and marketing only the most potential customer group, for this reason he saved lot bucks.This is how he launched beta version of his first product. He got the maximum profit margin, He latterly form a big business on that idea and become the successful businessman.</p>
